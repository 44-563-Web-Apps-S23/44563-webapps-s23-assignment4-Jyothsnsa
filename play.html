    <h3>THE GAZING GLOBE by _Eugene Pillot_</h3>
    <p>SCENE: _A soft cream-colored room, bare walled and unfurnished
        except for dull-blue grass mats on the floor and brilliant
        cushions. In the centre of rear wall is a great circular window
        with a dais before it, so that it may be used as a doorway. A
        gathered shade of soft blue silk covers the opening of the window._</p>
   <p>ZAMA. Be you forgetting, child, 'tis said that evil ball shows only the
   way to destruction!</p>
   <p>OHANO. Yes, these island people will create any myth, go any length, to
   keep one thinking, living in their narrow way. You are destined for evil
   if you try to follow the urge of your own heart--oh, yes, I know.</p>
   <p>ZAMA. But _your_ heart, child, should only be wanting the love of Nijo.</p>
   <p>OHANO. Nijo--I am hoping that he will be big enough to help me--but my
   lover has been away so long----</p>

   boat----</p>
