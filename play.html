    <h3>THE GAZING GLOBE by _Eugene Pillot_</h3>
    <p>SCENE: _A soft cream-colored room, bare walled and unfurnished
        except for dull-blue grass mats on the floor and brilliant
        cushions. In the centre of rear wall is a great circular window
        with a dais before it, so that it may be used as a doorway. A
        gathered shade of soft blue silk covers the opening of the window._</p>

   way to destruction!</p>
