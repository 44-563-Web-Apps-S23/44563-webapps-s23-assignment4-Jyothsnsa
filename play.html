    <h1>Jyothsna Naredla snips a play</h1>
    <h3>THE GAZING GLOBE by _Eugene Pillot_</h3>
    <p>SCENE: _A soft cream-colored room, bare walled and unfurnished
        except for dull-blue grass mats on the floor and brilliant
        cushions. In the centre of rear wall is a great circular window
        with a dais before it, so that it may be used as a doorway. A
        gathered shade of soft blue silk covers the opening of the window._</p>
        ZAMA. Listen--the horse! Ohano, your lover do be coming!

        <h6 class ="OHANO">OHANO.</h6> <p class = "directions">[_Running to the window._]</p> <p class="speech">Already? He must have taken the short
        way through the cliffs.</p>
        
        <h6 class="ZAMA">ZAMA.</h6> <p class="speech">Ah, child, do you not be excited as a bird in a storm-wind's
        blow?</p>
        
        <h6 class ="OHANO">OHANO.</h6><p class="directions">[_Superbly, as she leans against window._]</p><p class = "speech">Yes, I await my hero!</p>
        
        <h6 class ="ZAMA">ZAMA.</h6> <p class="speech">He's stopped, child! He do be here! At last he comes back to my
        little Ohano!</p>
        
        <h6 class ="OHANO">OHANO.</h6><p class="speech">My hope comes!</p><p class = "directions"> [_With outstretched arms to right._]</p><p class = "speech">My Nijo!!
        Oh----!</p>
        
             <p class = "directions">[_She had impulsively started to greet_ NIJO, _but suddenly shrinks
             back_.</p>
        
        <h6 class ="ZAMA">ZAMA.</h6> <p class="speech">What do be wrong--what?</p>
